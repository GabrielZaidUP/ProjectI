“After brainstorming ideas, I couldn’t set foot on which way I would go. Either use a small portion of the bootstrap documentation, or go full bootstrap on my web page. But what I did set foot on was the theme of my web page: children’s drawings. I don’t really know why, but it just seems really funny to me.”

“I decided to go full bootstrap on my webpage, now I just need to study it more thoroughly so I can work on it more easily.”

“Tried to come up with a design, but It’s a different story drawing a webpage than coding a web page. I'm having difficulties with the grid system of bootstrap.”

“It's not the way I wanted the index to look, but I'll keep it that way, so I can focus on other aspects of the webpage.”

“I focused on making everything in the page make sense by approaching the colors and styles of the page. I decided to go with a simple black and white design, and I'm still having problems with the grid system.”

“The webpage is finished, there are some problems with the index part of the page as in the part where i'm trying to make the gutter on the y axis bigger in one of the columns, I’ll try to fix it”
