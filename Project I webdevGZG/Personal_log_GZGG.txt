Notice:only add relevant information on what was worked on

As I'm finishing the webpage, I can say that I did my best to come up with something in good condition to be called a project. 
I put 100% effort into it to look the best as possible, but in reality that effort needs a little more web developing practice. 
That is, because my time coding exceeded my exceptions. It took me almost 4 hours just to set up an image to look good in all viewports. 
Additionally, trying to understand how the grid system works took me ages to get. Pushing my sanity to the limit.

With enough practice, knowledge,and a partner by my side, I can safely say I can bring forward a twice as better web page in half the time.
